         \section{Classification of Propulsion Systems}

    Propulsion is defined as \textit{"the action or process of propelling"} (\textit{"to drive forward or onward by or as if by means of a force that imparts motion"}). By the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. 

    It can also be defined as "the act of changing the motion of a body with respect to an inertial reference frame."\supercite{sutton2017}

    In engine propulsion, the most common way to achieve such thing is via \textit{chemical combustion}. The energy can also be supplied by \textit{solar radiation}, or a \textit{nuclear reactor}. As such, the varios types of propulsion can be generally divided up into three categories:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item chemical propulsion
        \item nuclear propulsion
        \item solar propulsion
    \end{itemize}

    Input in rocket propulsion systems is either heat or electricity. Useful output thrust comes from the kinetic energy of the ejected matter and from the propellant pressure on inner chamber walls and at the nozzle exit; thus. rocket propulsion systems primarily convert input energies into the kinetic energy of the exhausted gas. The ejected mass can be in a solid, liquid or gaseous state. Often, combinations of two or more states are ejected. At high enough temperatures, the ejected mass can also be in a state of plasma.\supercite{sutton2017}

    \subsection{Duct Jet Propulsion}
      Duct jet engines, more commonly called "air breathing" engines, are engines which utilize airflow that is then energized inside a duct. They use atmospheric oxygen to burn fuel stored onboard. This class includes the following:\supercite{sutton2017}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item turbojets
          \item turbofans
          \item ramjets
          \item pulse jets
          \item scramjets\supercite{segal2009}
      \end{itemize}
      They are mentioned here mainly as to provide a background and comparison to rocket propulsion engines.

      Out of all of the ducted engines, the \textit{turbojet engine} is the most widely used.

    \subsubsection{Ramjet Engine}
      For supersonic flight in the speeds above Mach 2, the \textit{ramjet engine} (which is a pure ducted engine) is the best suited within the earth's atmosphere. Its compression is purely gas dynamic and thrust is produced by increasing the momentum of the subsonic compressed air as it passes through the ramjet in a very similar manner to the functionality of \textit{turbofan} and \textit{turbojet} engines, just without any compressor or turbine hardware.\supercite{sutton2017} 

      \begin{figure}[H]

        \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{z_Assets/Graphics/Schematics/Ramjet_P280b.jpg}

        \label{fig:ramjet engine}
      \end{figure}

      Ramjets with subsonic combustion and hydrocarbon fuels have an upper speed limit of approx. 5 Mach; Hydrogen fuel with hydrogen cooling raises this maximum to at least 16 Mach.

    \subsubsection{Scramjet Engine}
      The Scramjet engine is a ramjet engine utilizing \textit{super sonic combustion}. Which allows for much freeer and faster air flow than \textit{turbojet} or \textit{ramjet} engines.
      \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering

        \label{fig:scramjet engine_comparison}
      \end{figure}
      So far, Scramjet engines have only been used in a few prototype vehicles and military experiments. A Scramjet relies on high vehicle speed to compress the incoming air forcefully before combustion (hence sc (\textit{supersonic combustion}) \textbf{ramjet}), but whereas a ramjet decelerates the air to subsonic velocities before combustion using shock cones, a Scramjet has no shock cone and slows the airflow using shockwaves produced by its ignition source in place of a shock cone.\supercite{segal2009}${}^;$\supercite{Wiki_scramjet}



      \subsection{Rocket Propulsion}
      Rocket propulsion is based fundamentally on \textit{Newton’s Third Law of Motion} — for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In a rocket engine, the “action” is the high-velocity expulsion of exhaust gases, while the “reaction” propels the vehicle forward. Unlike air-breathing engines, rockets carry both fuel and oxidizer, allowing them to function in the vacuum of space.\supercite{sutton2017}

\subsubsection{Chemical Rocket Engines}
Chemical propulsion remains the most widely used method of achieving thrust in spaceflight. It relies on the combustion of chemical propellants that release large amounts of thermal energy, which is converted into kinetic energy of the exhaust gases. Two major types exist: \textit{solid} and \textit{liquid} rocket engines.\supercite{sutton2017}

\paragraph{Solid Rocket Engines}
Solid rocket motors use propellants in a single solid mixture, often consisting of a powdered oxidizer (such as ammonium perchlorate) combined with a binder that also acts as fuel. They are mechanically simple, capable of long storage, and deliver high thrust rapidly after ignition. However, they cannot be throttled or shut down once ignited, limiting flexibility.\supercite{sutton2017}

    \textbf{(3)} The cylindrical hole in the propellant acts as a combustion chamber.
    \textbf{(4)} The hot exhaust is choked at the throat, which, among other things, dictates the amount of thrust produced.
  \textbf{(5)} Exhaust exits the rocket.

}\label{fig:solid-fuel-rocket-diagram}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Liquid Rocket Engines}
Liquid-propellant engines store the oxidizer and fuel in separate tanks and feed them into a combustion chamber using pumps or pressurization. The most common combinations are RP-1 (refined kerosene) with liquid oxygen (\ce{LOX}), or liquid hydrogen (\ce{LH2}) with \ce{LOX}. They can be throttled, restarted, and provide high efficiency but require complex plumbing and cryogenic storage.\supercite{sutton2017}

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Hybrid Rocket Engines}
A hybrid rocket uses a combination of a liquid oxidizer and a solid fuel. This design offers a compromise between the safety of solid motors and the controllability of liquid systems. Notable examples include SpaceShipOne’s nitrous oxide (\ce{N2O}) and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (\ce{HTPB}) hybrid engine.\supercite{sutton2017}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Non-Chemical Rocket Engines}
Beyond chemical propulsion, various non-chemical systems have been developed to improve efficiency and endurance for deep-space missions.

\paragraph{Electric Propulsion}
Electric propulsion systems, such as ion and Hall-effect thrusters, use electrical energy (from solar arrays or nuclear sources) to accelerate charged particles. They produce low thrust but extremely high specific impulse, making them ideal for long-duration missions where gradual acceleration is acceptable.\supercite{sutton2017}

\paragraph{Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP)}
In nuclear thermal systems, a nuclear reactor heats a propellant—typically hydrogen—to extremely high temperatures before expansion through a nozzle. This method can theoretically double the specific impulse compared to chemical rockets, offering a promising balance between power and efficiency for interplanetary travel.\supercite{sutton2017}
  \section{Emerging Propulsion Technologies}
    % (Ion engines, nuclear thermal propulsion, solar sails, and antimatter or fusion concepts.)
    As mentioned at the beginning of this work, there still are ideas and possible engines that have yet to depart the zone of science fiction as either our technology isn't advanced enough to produce and test such engines or they have been demonstrated to not be technically effective for their complexity/price or we have no use for them yet. I shall talk about a select few of these in the following parts. Mainly the following:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Nuclear Propulsion (both Fusion and Fission)
      \item Ion Engines 
      \item Solar Sails
      \item Antimatter Engines
      \item Field Propulsion
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Fusion}
    \subsubsection{Fission}

    \subsection{Ion Engines}

    \subsection{Solar Sails}

    \subsection{Antimatter Engines}

    \subsection{Field Propulsion}
  Field propulsion, as defined by Yoshinari Minami is the act of propulsion not by usual means of momentum thrust, but instead by pressure thrust derived from an interaction of a spaceship with the physical structure of space-time. (Assuming that space as a vacuum possesses a substantial physical structure.)\supercite{minami2018}\\

    As the theory stands, field propulsion remains speculative and has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. It arises from the idea that spacetime itself may be manipulated to create a net force on a spacecraft without the expulsion of reaction mass. Concepts such as the \textit{Alcubierre warp drive}, derived from solutions to Einstein’s field equations, suggest that spacetime could theoretically be contracted in front of and expanded behind a spacecraft, allowing apparent faster-than-light travel.\supercite{minami2018}

    However, the energy requirements are currently astronomical, exceeding the mass–energy of entire planets, and the feasibility of generating negative energy densities remains purely theoretical. Despite these limitations, research into quantum vacuum interactions and general relativistic field manipulation continues at a conceptual level, keeping the idea alive in advanced propulsion discussions.\supercite{minami2018}


  \section{Theoretical Framework for Interstellar Propulsion}
    Interstellar travel demands propulsion technologies far beyond current chemical or even nuclear capabilities. Several theoretical and conceptual projects have proposed methods to achieve fractions of the speed of light.

\subsection{Project Daedalus}
Conceived in the 1970s by the British Interplanetary Society, \textit{Project Daedalus} proposed a two-stage fusion-powered spacecraft capable of reaching 12\% the speed of light. It would use pellets of deuterium and helium-3 ignited by electron beams to produce thrust. Though technologically beyond current reach, Daedalus provided a credible engineering framework for interstellar flight.\supercite{project_daedalus_propulsion}

\subsection{Breakthrough Starshot}
A modern descendant of the Daedalus concept, \textit{Breakthrough Starshot} envisions launching gram-scale probes accelerated by ground-based laser arrays to 20\% the speed of light. The probes would use lightweight sails reflecting focused laser beams, allowing rapid travel to nearby stars like Proxima Centauri within a human lifetime.\supercite{Wiki_breakthrough_starshot}

\subsection{The Alcubierre Drive}
Proposed by Miguel Alcubierre in 1994, the \textit{warp drive} concept relies on the manipulation of spacetime geometry, compressing space ahead of the craft and expanding it behind. This would allow effective faster-than-light travel without violating local relativistic constraints. Nonetheless, it requires exotic matter with negative energy density, which has not been observed in usable quantities.\supercite{alcubierre1994}
\\

These speculative frameworks demonstrate the profound link between physics and engineering in the pursuit of interstellar travel, emphasizing that humanity’s ultimate propulsion systems may rely as much on breakthroughs in fundamental science as on technological advancement.

\section{Rocket physics fundamentals}
\subsection{Specific Impulse}
      The \textit{specific impulse $I_s$} represents the thrust per unit propellant "weight" flow rate. It is an important figure of merit of the performance of any rocket propulsion system, a concept similar to kilometers per liter or miles per hour as applied to an automobile. A higher number often indicates a better performance. If the total propellant mass flow rate is $\dot{m}$ and the standard acceleration of gravity is $g_0$ (with an \textit{average} value at the Earth's sea level of $9.8066\ m/sec^2$ or $32.174\ ft/sec^2$), then 
      \begin{equation} \label{eq:Specific Impulse}
        I_s = \frac{\int_{0}^{t}Fdt}{g_{0} \int_0^t \dot{m}dt}
      \end{equation}

\subsection{Escape velocity}
Escaoe velocity can be defined as "the minimum speed needed for an object to escape from contact with or orbit of a primary body, assuming:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ballistic trajectory (no other forces are acting on the object, such as propulsion or friction).
  \item No other gravity-producing objects exist."
\end{itemize}
while the term "velocity" is used colloquially, a more accurate represntation would be "speed" as it is independent of direction.
Escape speed at a distance d from the center of a spherically symmetric primary body (such as a star or a planet) with mass M is given by the formula:
$$
v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{d}} = \sqrt{2gd}
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $G$ is the universal gravitational constant ($G\approx 6.67\times 10^{-11}m^3\times kg^{-1}\times s^{-2}$)
  \item $g = GM/d^2$ is the local gravitational acceleration (or the surface gravity, when d = r).
\end{itemize}
The value $GM$ is called the \textit{gravitational standard parameter}, or $\mu$.
When given an initial speed $V$ greater than the escape speed $v_e$, the object will asymptotically approach the hyperboflic excess speed $v_{\infty}$, satisfying the equation:
$$
v_{\infty}^2 = V^2 - v_e^2
$$
for example, with the definitional value for standard gravity of $9.80665 m/s^2$, the escape velocity for Earth is $11.186\ km/s\ (40,270\ km/h)$.\supercite{Wiki_escape-velocity}
\subsection{Tsoilkovsky's Rocket Equation}
Also called the \textit{Classical Rocket Equation} or \textit{Ideal Rocket Equation}. It describes the motion of vehicles based on the concept of a rocket, defined as "a device that can apply acceleration to itself using thrust by expelling part of its mass with high velocity and can thereby move due to the conservation of momentum".\supercite{Wiki_tsiolkovskys-equation}\\
The maximum change of velociry of thr rocket, $\Delta v$ (with no extrenal forces acting) is:
$$
\Delta v = v_e ln \frac{m_0}{m_f} = I_{sp}g_0 ln\frac{m_0}{m_f}
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $v_e$ is the effective exhaust velocity (also equal to $I_{sp}g_0$)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $I_{sp}$ is the specific impulse in the dimension of time
      \item $g_0$ is standard gravity
    \end{itemize}
  \item $ln$ is the natural logarithm function
  \item $m_0$ is the initial total mass, including propellant (i.e. "wet mass")
  \item $m_f$ is the final total mass, excluding propellant (i.e. "dry mass")
\end{itemize}

Due to the effective exhaust velocity being determined by rocket engine's design, the desired $\Delta v$ (e.g. orbital speed, or escape velocity), and a given dry mass ($m_f$), the equation can be solved for the required wet mass ($m_0$):
$$
m_0 = m_{f}e^{\Delta v/v_e}
$$
The required propellant mass is then: 
$$
m_0 - m_f = m_f(e^{\Delta v/v_e}-1)
$$
This shows us, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:massratio_vs_exhaustratio}, that the nescessary wet mass grows exponentionally with the desired $\Delta v$.\supercite{Wiki_tsiolkovskys-equation}

  \label{fig:massratio_vs_exhaustratio}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Coriolis Force}
Also known as the \textit{Coriolis effect}, the Coriolis force is a pseudo force that acts on objects in motion within a frame of reference that rotates with respect to an inertial frame. In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the force acts to the left of the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise (or counterclockwise) rotation, the force acts to the right. Deflection of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the Coriolis effect. \supercite{Wiki_coriolis-force}

In Newtonian mechanics, the equation of motion for an object in an inertial reference frame is:
$$
F = ma
$$
where $F$ is the vector sum of the physical forces acting on the object, $m$ is the mass of the object and $a$ is the acceleration of the object relative to the inertial reference frame. Transforming this equation to a reference frame rotating about a fixed axis through the origin with angular velocity $\omega$ having variable rotation rate, the equation takes the 
following form:
$$
F' = F-m\frac{d\omega}{dt}\times r'-2m\omega\times v' - m\omega\times (\omega\times r')
$$
where the prime ($'$) variables denote coordinates of the rotating reference frame (not a derivative) and: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item $F$ is the vector sum of the physical forces acting on the object.
  \item $\omega$ is the angular velocity of the rotating reference frame relative to the inertial frame.
  \item $r'$ is the position vector of the object relative to the rotating reference frame. 
  \item $v'$ is the velocity of the object relative to the rotating reference frame.
  \item $a'$ is the acceleration of the object relative to the rotating reference frame.
\end{itemize}
The fictitious forces as they are perceived in the rotating frame act as additional forces that contribute to the apparent acceleration just like the real external forces. The fictitious force terms of the equation are, reading from left to right:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Euler force: $-m\frac{d\omega}{dt}\times r'$
  \item Coriolis force: $-2m(\omega\times v')$
  \item Centrifugal force: $-m\omega\times(\omega\times r')$
\end{itemize}
As seen in these formulas the Euler and centrifugal forces depend on the position vector ($r'$) of the object, while the Coriolis force depends on the object's velocity ($v'$) as measured in the rotating reference frame. As expected, for a non-rotating inertial frame of reference ($\omega = 0$) the Coriolis force and all other fictitious forces disappear.

\subsection{Nozzle flow and geometry}
Rocket engine nozzles, also called propelling nozzles. They are usually of de Laval type (See Figure~\ref{fig:de-laval-nozzle}) used in a rocket engine to expand and accelerate combustion products to high supersonic velocities.\supercite{Wiki_rocket-nozzle}${}^;$\supercite{doi:10.1021/acsomega.1c07050}

Typically, the design of a nozzle aims to achieve maiximum thrust coefficient ($C_F$) potential, which acts as a strong multiplier to the exhaust velocity inherent to the combustion chamber alone (it's characteristic velocity ($c^*$, which is independent of nozzle design).\supercite{Wiki_rocket-nozzle}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{z_Assets/Graphics/Schematics/De_laval_nozzle.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A de Laval nozzle, showing approximate flow velocity increasing from green to red in the direction of flow\supercite{Img_de-laval-nozzle}}\label{fig:de-laval-nozzle}
\end{figure}

The analysis of gas flow through de Laval nozzles involves a number of concepts and simplifying assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The combustion gas is an ideal gas.
  \item The gas flow is isentropic.
  \item The gas flow rate is constant during the period of the propellant burn.
  \item The gas flow rate is non-turbulent and axisymmetric from gas inlet to exhaust gas exit.
  \item The flow is compressible as the fluid is a gas.
\end{itemize}

As the combustion gas enters the rocket nozzle, it is traveling at subsonic velocities. As the throat constricts, the gas is forced to accelerate until at the nozzle throat, where the cross-sectional area is the least, the linear velocity becomes sonic. From the throat the cross-sectional area then increases, the gas expands and the linear velocity becomes progressively more supersonic.

The linear velocity of the exiting exhaust gases can be calculated using the following equation:
$$
v_e = \sqrt{\frac{TR}{M}\times\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1}[1-(\frac{p_e}{p})^{\frac{\gamma -1}{\gamma}}]}
$$
